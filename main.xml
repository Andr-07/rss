<title>I thought 2024 would be grim and predictable, then I saw the words ‘secret illegal tunnel under Brooklyn’ | Emma Brockes</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/10/new-york-secret-illegal-brooklyn-tunnel-religious-diggers</link>
<description><p>Even to hardened New Yorkers, a tale of renegade religious diggers pursued by shovel-wielding police officers is irresistible</p><p>With <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/07/north-east-winter-storm-snow-freezing-rain">storms battering the US </a>and Donald Trump back in court <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/09/donald-trump-2020-election-federal-appeals-court-criminal-prosecution">claiming immunity</a> this week, light relief comes in the form of a news story we didn’t know we needed: the discovery in Brooklyn of a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/09/brooklyn-synagogue-secret-tunnel-dispute-arrests">secret tunnel</a>, apparently dug by a faction within the ultra-religious Chabad-Lubavitch community. The tunnel, which runs for 15m (50ft), starts under the synagogue and peters out beneath a ritual bath house several buildings along. When cops arrived on Monday to fill it with concrete, they met with strong resistance from the tunnellers. What can only be described as a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2024/jan/10/secret-tunnel-in-brooklyn-synagogue-leads-to-brawl-and-arrests-video">melee ensued</a>.</p><p>There’s a lot to unpack here, but let’s start with “illegal tunnelling”, which, with all due deference to a group of worshippers in distress, triggers in the abstract a bolt of joy at the sheer range and eccentricity of human behaviour. The tunnel in Brooklyn’s Crown Heights neighbourhood was reportedly dug by a group of young male students, characterised by Hassidic leaders as “extremist”, for purposes that remain obscure. What is known is that residents in homes neighbouring the synagogue reported suspicious sounds coming from beneath the floor. When city officials turned up to investigate, they unearthed some kind of religious take on The Shawshank Redemption that contravened – big New York obsession, up there with homicide – various building regulations and codes. It’s not a prohibition many of us have had cause to test, but I guess you need a permit to dig a tunnel in the city?</p><p>Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

<title>We have a tool to stop Israel's war crimes: BDS | Naomi Klein</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/10/only-outside-pressure-can-stop-israels-war-crimes</link>
<description><p>In 2005, Palestinians called on the world to boycott Israel until it complied with international law. What if we had listened?</p><p>Exactly 15 years ago this week, I published an <a href="https://amp.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jan/10/naomi-klein-boycott-israel">article</a> in the Guardian. It began like this:</p><p>It’s time. Long past time. The best strategy to end the increasingly bloody occupation is for Israel to become the target of the kind of global movement that put an end to apartheid in South Africa. In July 2005 a huge coalition of Palestinian groups laid out plans to do just that. They called on ‘people of conscience all over the world to impose broad boycotts and implement divestment initiatives against Israel similar to those applied to South Africa in the apartheid era’. The campaign Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions was born.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/10/only-outside-pressure-can-stop-israels-war-crimes">Continue reading...</a></description>

<title>Do pregnant women have a right to urgent medical care? No, according to a US court | Moira Donegan</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/10/pregnant-women-urgent-medical-care-us-court-texas</link>
<description><p>Federal judges sided with a Texas law that allows the state to push pregnant patients to the brink of death before allowing medically necessary abortion</p><p>Do doctors have an obligation under federal law to keep their patients alive, even if their patients happen to be pregnant women? Do doctors have an obligation to prevent maiming – or irreversible organ damage, or other kinds of serious bodily harm – and if so, does that obligation extend even to women? Do women have a right to access medically necessary care even if they are pregnant? No, according to the US fifth circuit court.</p><p>That’s the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca5.212720/gov.uscourts.ca5.212720.134.1.pdf">conclusion</a> reached by a three-judge panel recently in Texas v Becerra, a case in which Texas sued the Biden administration over guidance that directed all hospitals receiving federal funds to perform “necessary stabilizing treatment” on patients – including abortions on pregnant patients undergoing medical emergencies.</p><p>Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/10/pregnant-women-urgent-medical-care-us-court-texas">Continue reading...</a></description>

<title>Is it OK to speculate about Taylor Swift’s sexuality? | Arwa Mahdawi</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/10/taylor-swift-op-ed-lgbt-sexuality-right-wrong-discuss-celebrity</link>
<description><p>I take more offence at the idea that it’s upsetting to discuss a public person’s sexuality in 2024 – especially when no one seems perturbed at gossip about celebrities’ <em>straight</em> sex lives</p><p>For about 18 months there was incredibly disruptive construction going on next door to me. It drove me mad. Like verging-on-a-nervous-breakdown mad. I became obsessed with the history of construction-related legislation in Philadelphia and pitched one of my editors a 10,000-word piece on planning permission and party walls. They looked at me kindly and said “no”.</p><p>All of which to say: sometimes you need an editor to rein you in. Sometimes you need an editor to tell you that while it’s OK for you to be weirdly obsessed about something, it might be best if you didn’t go down a rabbit hole on the opinion pages of a national newspaper.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/10/taylor-swift-op-ed-lgbt-sexuality-right-wrong-discuss-celebrity">Continue reading...</a></description>

<title>The Guardian view on Ecuador’s gang violence: a domestic crisis with transnational roots | Editorial</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/10/the-guardian-view-on-ecuadors-gang-violence-a-domestic-crisis-with-transnational-roots</link>
<description><p>The Latin American nation, once relatively safe, is now in the grip of organised crime. There are no swift or easy solutions</p><p>“All I know is that it’s time to leave this country, and go very far away.” Those words, from a staff member at the TV station <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/10/ecuador-tv-station-attack-workers">attacked by masked gunmen</a> live on air on Tuesday, encapsulate the shock and despair that many in Ecuador now feel. The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/10/ecuador-tv-studio-gang-attack-prison-break">assault on TC Televisión</a> in Guayaquil, Ecuador’s most dangerous city, was one of multiple spectacular and coordinated attacks by gangs, in which at least 10 people were killed.</p><p>Murderous crime has soared over recent years. But this was not just about gangs running rampant and battling each other with a sense of impunity, while brutalising anyone who got in their way. The invasion of a university and hospitals, the kidnapping and killing of police and prison guards, the torching of cars in residential areas, attacks in the Amazon region and looting in the capital, Quito – all these showed gangs operating well outside their usual fiefdoms, banding together, and turning on national institutions and civilians to try to force political leaders to back off. This strategic brutality, which <a href="https://twitter.com/ioangrillo/status/1744855686209823045">has been described</a> as “violent lobbying”, has been used elsewhere in Latin America, but is new to Ecuador. For many, it feels as if the fate of the country itself is at stake.</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

<title>What’s the secret of packing light for a holiday? Ask my mum | Adrian Chiles</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/10/whats-the-secret-of-packing-light-for-a-holiday-ask-my-mum</link>
<description><p>She can fit months’ worth of essentials into the tiniest of bags. I go big – and still always forget something</p><p>I’m rubbish at packing. Be it for a night away or for several months, I’m hopeless. I never, but never, fail to forget something essential. A toothbrush, medication, pants, the suitcase itself – you name it. And always, but always, more than half of what I take isn’t needed. I’ve given up worrying about this. When I was a younger man I was foolish enough to harbour hopes of one day wanting for nothing while I was away. Never happened; never will.</p><p>But I’d rather be me than one of those clever dicks who fits enough for a month in the tiniest, piddliest little cases which, notwithstanding their laughable smallness, are nevertheless equipped with no fewer than four wheels. Four! You see them in airports, these things, their smug owners wheeling them around like they’re walking prim little poodles off to the shops.</p><p>Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster, writer and Guardian columnist</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?
